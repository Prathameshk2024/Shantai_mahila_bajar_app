/**
 * THE HALF-FILLED REGISTRATION
 * ============================
 * Six screens of answers, kept on the device so that leaving the wizard does
 * not throw them away. Before this, everything lived in `useState`: a back
 * press on step 1, a reload, or the browser reclaiming the tab wiped the lot -
 * and back sent her to the phone screen, so she also spent a second OTP
 * proving a number she had proved two minutes earlier.
 *
 * KEYED BY PHONE, and that is the whole point of this file existing separately.
 * The product wizard learned this the hard way (see productDraft.ts): one
 * shared key meant a field coordinator's phone showed the NEXT woman whatever
 * the last one had typed. Registration is worse - the draft holds her name,
 * her village and her UPI id. The phone number from her verification ticket is
 * the identity being registered, so it is the right key.
 *
 * sessionStorage, not localStorage: her ticket lives fifteen minutes, so a
 * draft that outlived the tab would be a form she could fill in but never
 * submit - and a half-registered woman's details would sit on a shared handset
 * for whoever picked it up next.
