 * The bell in the app bar, carrying a count of what happened while she was away.
 *
 * It fetches its own orders rather than taking `useAsync` from `ui.tsx`: the
 * bar lives in `ui.tsx`, so importing back the other way would be a cycle
 * between the two files that every screen loads.
 *
 * The count is DERIVED from her own orders (see lib/notifications.ts) - no new
 * endpoint, no polling, no second copy of facts the app already holds. It is
 * read when the bar mounts, which is each time she opens a screen.
