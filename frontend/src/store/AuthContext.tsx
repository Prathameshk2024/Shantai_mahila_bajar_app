/**
 * Session state. One phone number can be both a seller and a customer, so the
 * account carries a role rather than being two separate accounts - that avoids
 * asking the same woman for her details twice.
 *
 * The OTP is verified on the SERVER. This context only stores what came back.
 *
 * WHAT ENDS A SESSION
 * ===================
 * Exactly two things:
 *
 *   1. she presses Log out;
 *   2. the server answers 401, meaning the token it issued is no longer valid.
 *
 * Nothing else. Not a back press, not a reload, not opening /seller a second
 * time. That list used to be longer by accident: the refreshed token the
 * server hands back mid-session was written to the api client's copy only, so
 * the next reload restored the ORIGINAL token from here and threw the slide
 * away. `onTokenRefresh` closes that gap - a re-stamped token is written back
 * into the stored session, which is what makes the seven-day window an
 * inactivity window rather than a countdown from login.
