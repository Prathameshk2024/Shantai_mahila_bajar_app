/**
 * WHAT CHANGED SINCE SHE LAST LOOKED
 * ==================================
 * A customer places an order and then hears nothing. The seller accepts it,
 * packs it, sets off with it - four real events, none of which reached the
 * person waiting at home. Her only option was to open the order and read the
 * timeline, which means knowing to look.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT STORED. Every one of these events is already on the order as an
 * `OrderEvent { to, at, by }`, and both sides already fetch their own orders.
 * A `notifications` collection would be a second copy of facts we hold, kept
 * in step by hand, and wrong the first time somebody forgot to write a row.
 * Nothing here needs a new endpoint or a new table.
 *
 * This is NOT push. The app has to be open. Real push needs FCM and a
 * device-token registry, and the honest version of that is a separate piece of
 * work - see "Not built yet" in CLAUDE.md. What this does is make sure that
 * when she DOES open the app, nothing that happened is hidden from her.
