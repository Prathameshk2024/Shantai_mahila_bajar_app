/**
 * MSG91 keeps its OTP session in page memory, and the phone screen and the OTP
 * screen are two routes. A reload between them - HMR in development, a dropped
 * connection, Android reclaiming a tab she backgrounded to go and read the SMS
 * - loses that session, and MSG91 then answers every code with
 * "reqId is required.". That reached her as "that OTP is wrong", so she retyped
 * the right code until she gave up: the one button that recovers it, "send
 * again", was itself a retry on the session that had gone.
 *
 * These tests are about that dead end. They run against ONE module instance in
 * order, because "this page load has not sent anything yet" is exactly the
 * state a reload leaves behind and cannot be re-entered afterwards.
