 * TELL HER WHAT THE OFFICE JUST DID.

 * Every other line in her updates list is derived from an order, because an
 * order records its own history. An admin decision does not: a granted pack
 * only makes a number bigger, so unless the decision is written down at the
 * moment it is made, "you were given 5 slots on Tuesday" cannot be recovered
 * afterwards. Written by the handler that made the change, so the record and
 * the decision can never disagree.
 *
 * Trimmed to the last 30. This rides along inside her seller document on every
 * read she makes, and nobody scrolls two years of admin decisions.
