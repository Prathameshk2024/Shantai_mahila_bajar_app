/**
 * CUSTOMER RECORDS
 * ================
 * Every function here takes the customer id the caller is *authenticated as*
 * and will not touch anything filed under a different id. That is the whole
 * privacy rule, kept in one place: the routes are thin wrappers that pass
 * `req.auth.customerId` straight through and never read an id from the body.
 *
 * An address id is looked up only inside that customer's own array, so a
 * guessed id belonging to someone else is indistinguishable from one that does
 * not exist - the caller cannot tell the difference, and neither outcome
 * reveals anything.
 *
 * Pure functions over a `Db`: no Firestore, no request objects, no module
 * state. Persisting is the caller's job, by calling `save()` afterwards.
