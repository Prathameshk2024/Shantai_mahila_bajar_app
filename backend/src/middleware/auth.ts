/**
 * WHO IS CALLING
 * ==============
 * Two gates, in this order, and both must pass:
 *
 *   1. the token's signature and its issue time - cheap, no lookup, throws out
 *      forgeries and ancient tokens before they cost anything;
 *   2. the session record it points at - the authority on whether that session
 *      still exists, has been revoked, or has idled out.
 *
 * The second gate is the one that is new, and it is the whole point. Identity
 * is read from the RECORD, never from the token: `req.auth.sellerId` comes out
 * of the row in the database, so a token cannot assert an identity the server
 * did not issue even if the signing key were somehow forged. It also means
 * "log out" and "revoke her stolen phone" are real, because deleting the row
 * kills every token pointing at it.
 *
 * To go live on Firebase Auth instead: mint a Firebase custom token after the
 * OTP check and have the client sign in with it; this middleware then becomes
 * `getAuth().verifyIdToken(bearer)` plus the same session lookup. Admin is
 * gated by a custom claim, and the same rule is repeated in Firestore security
 * rules - never in the UI alone.
