/**
 * CLOUDINARY — SIGNED DIRECT UPLOAD
 * =================================
 * The browser uploads straight to Cloudinary; the image bytes never touch this
 * server. That keeps a 3MB photo off our bandwidth and out of our request
 * limits, and it is markedly faster on a rural connection.
 *
 * The API secret stays here. We only hand the client a signature that is valid
 * for one upload, into one folder, at one moment. An *unsigned* preset would
 * be simpler but lets anyone on the internet fill your Cloudinary account.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   client → POST /api/uploads/signature   (authenticated)
 *   client → POST to Cloudinary with file + signature
 *   client → sends the returned secure_url with the product
