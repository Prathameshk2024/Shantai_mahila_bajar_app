/**
 * RATE LIMITING
 * =============
 * In process, with no new dependency, because this deployment is pinned to a
 * single instance anyway - the datastore has the same constraint and states it
 * in db/firestore.ts. A shared limiter (Redis) is the change to make at the
 * same time as making the store shared, not before: two limiters on two
 * instances would let through twice the traffic, which is a known and bounded
 * failure, whereas two datastores silently overwrite each other.
 *
 * A fixed window, not a token bucket. Fixed windows allow a burst across a
 * boundary - up to double the limit at the seam - and for these numbers that
 * does not matter: the point is to make ten thousand OTP guesses impossible,
 * not to smooth traffic. Simple enough to read in one sitting beats subtle.
 *
 * Every limit is keyed by BOTH a subject (a phone, an email) and an IP.
 * Subject alone lets an attacker walk through numbers; IP alone punishes a
 * whole village behind one carrier NAT, which in rural Maharashtra is a real
 * shape of traffic and not a hypothetical.
