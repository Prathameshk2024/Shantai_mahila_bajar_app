/**
 * THE BEARER TOKEN
 * ================
 * `base64url({sid, role, iat}).base64url(HMAC(payload))`
 *
 * Note what is NOT in there any more: the user id, the seller id, the customer
 * id. The token used to carry all three, which made it a self-contained claim
 * about who you are - and a claim is only as good as the checking around it.
 * Now it carries a POINTER to a session record, and identity is read from that
 * record on every request. Two things follow:
 *
 *  - a token cannot assert an identity the server did not issue, even in
 *    principle, because there is no identity in it to tamper with;
 *  - the session can be revoked. Deleting the record kills the token
 *    instantly, which is what makes "log out" and "her phone was stolen" mean
 *    something. Before this, both were client-side wishes.
 *
 * `iat` and `role` stay because they let an ancient token be thrown out before
 * it costs a lookup, and because the idle window differs by role. They are a
 * cheap first gate, never the last word: `sessions.ts` is the authority.

 * Different by role because the risk is different. An admin token approves
 * payments, blocks sellers and can read every buyer's home address, and it is
 * used at a desk where signing in again costs a few seconds - so it is short.
 * A seller's token is on a phone in a village, and re-issuing it costs an SMS
 * and a literacy hurdle, so a week is the kinder trade.
 *
 * This is an IDLE window, not an absolute one: every authenticated request
 * slides it forward, so somebody using the app regularly is never signed out
 * in the middle of something.
