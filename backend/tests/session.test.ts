/**
 * Sessions expire on inactivity.
 *
 * The window differs by role because the risk does. An admin token approves
 * payments, blocks sellers and reads every buyer's address, and it is used at
 * a desk where signing in again costs nothing - so it is short. A seller's
 * token is on a phone in a village, and re-issuing it costs an SMS and a
 * literacy hurdle, so it lives longer.
 *
 * The window is IDLE, not absolute: every authenticated request slides it
 * forward, so someone using the app daily is never signed out mid-task.
 *
 * This file covers the TOKEN half of that. The session record enforces the
 * same window server-side and adds the absolute ceiling - see sessions.test.ts
 * - because a client that simply refuses to hand its token back could
 * otherwise keep an old one alive by never letting it be re-stamped.
