/**
 * ICONS
 * =====
 * Same arrangement as the seller app's `components/icons.tsx`: every icon in
 * the console comes from react-icons, and every screen imports it from HERE
 * rather than from `react-icons/*` directly. The set can then be swapped in one
 * file, and a screen reads as intent (`IconPayments`) rather than as a vendor's
 * naming scheme.
 *
 * Emoji were wrong here for a reason beyond taste. This console is read on a
 * desk in Windows, where 💵 renders as a flat green rectangle and 👩 as a
 * full-colour photograph of a face - two glyphs at different visual weights
 * sitting in the same navigation column, neither of them matching the maroon
 * and cream around them. A line icon takes `currentColor`, so it belongs to
 * the palette instead of fighting it.
