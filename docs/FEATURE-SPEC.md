# Shantai Mahila Bazar — Feature Specification

Women entrepreneurs sell, customers buy, admin monitors. Delivery is manual and handled
directly between seller and buyer. Sellers and customers use the **app** (mobile-first web,
wrappable into a native app). Admin uses the **web** console.

Priority tags: **[P0]** build in the skeleton · **[P1]** needed before real launch · **[P2]** later.

## 1. Decisions to lock before building

These change the database shape, so they are cheaper to answer now than to migrate later.

| # | Question | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Can one phone number be both seller and customer? | Yes — one account with `roles[]` and a role switcher. Avoids duplicate KYC. |
| 2 | Cart with items from three sellers? | Split into three orders under one `order_group`. Delivery and payment are both per-seller, so it has to be. |
| 3 | Is the ₹50 lifetime or does it expire? | Model it as `plans(price, slots, validity_days)` with `validity_days = NULL` meaning lifetime. Ship as lifetime; you can switch to yearly later without a migration. |
| 4 | Do product **drafts** consume a slot? | No. Only products that are live, pending approval, or paused. Archiving a product frees its slot — otherwise a woman with 5 bad listings is permanently stuck. |
| 5 | Does the platform take a commission on orders? | Recommend **no** in v1. The money goes buyer → seller directly via her UPI; the platform never holds it. That avoids payment-aggregator licensing entirely. |
| 6 | Who guarantees the delivery happened? | Nobody but the seller — which is exactly why you need a delivery OTP. |
| 7 | Languages | **Marathi (default) + English.** Hindi is easy to add later since the i18n layer is the same. |
| 8 | Android only for v1? | The share-QR requirement points at the Play Store, so yes — Android first. iOS deferred deep linking is harder and can wait. |
| 9 | How is a seller's service area defined? | A pincode list per seller. Simplest thing that works for manual delivery. |

---

## 2. The order lifecycle is the product

Delivery is manual, so the state machine carries everything. Every other feature hangs off it.

**This sequence is locked. Six states, in this order, no additions:**

```
PLACED → ACCEPTED → PACKED → OUT FOR DELIVERY → DELIVERED → COMPLETED
```

Payment is deliberately *not* a step in this chain — see below. Adding a payment state
into the middle is the change that would break it, because a cash order and a UPI order
have to walk the same six screens.

### Happy path

| State | Who moves it | What gets captured |
|---|---|---|
| `PLACED` | Customer | items, address, payment mode, 4-digit delivery OTP generated |
| `ACCEPTED` | Seller | must accept before a timer expires (say 2 h) or it auto-cancels |
| `PACKED` | Seller | optional ready-by time |
| `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` | Seller | who is delivering (self / family / helper), expected time |
| `DELIVERED` | Seller | **must enter the customer's delivery OTP** |
| `COMPLETED` | System | automatic, once the return window closes |

### Exceptions

| State | Who | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `REJECTED` | Seller | reason required: out of stock, can't deliver there, shop closed |
| `CANCELLED_BY_CUSTOMER` | Customer | only before dispatch, reason required |
| `CANCELLED_BY_SELLER` | Seller | reason required, counts against her metrics |
| `RETURN_REQUESTED` → `RETURN_APPROVED` → `REFUNDED` | Buyer / Seller / Admin | photo proof and reason. Food is non-returnable by default |
| `DISPUTED` | Either party | routed to the admin desk with the full timeline |

### Payment status is a separate axis

Because money moves buyer → seller directly, payment does **not** belong in the order state machine.
Track it in its own column:

`COD_PENDING` → `COD_COLLECTED` · `UPI_SUBMITTED` → `UPI_CONFIRMED_BY_SELLER` · `REFUND_PENDING` → `REFUNDED`

### Rules that matter

- Every transition writes a row to `order_status_events` — actor, timestamp, note, optional GPS. That table **is** what admin monitors.
- The customer's phone stays **masked until the seller accepts**, and the seller's likewise.
- **Stuck-order alarms:** accepted with no dispatch in X hours, or out for delivery with no delivery in Y hours → admin alert plus a nudge to the seller.
- The buyer sees the OTP on the confirmation screen with one instruction, in Marathi: *give this number to the seller when your order arrives.*

---

## 3. Registration fee & product slots

### The flow

₹50 buys one **pack**: 5 product slots. Want a 6th product? Buy another pack — 5 more slots, 10 total.
There is no payment gateway; she pays the admin's bank/UPI account directly and admin approves it by hand.

```
1. Phone + OTP                     → account created
2. Fill profile + shop + her UPI   → seller_profile saved
3. PAYMENT SCREEN (blocking)       → admin's UPI QR + bank details + "₹50"
   she pays from her own UPI app
4. She enters the UTR / reference number + uploads the payment screenshot
5. status = PAYMENT_SUBMITTED      → she waits
6. Admin sees it in the approvals queue, checks the bank statement
7. Approve  → status = ACTIVE, +5 slots granted, SMS + push to her
   Reject   → reason shown, she can resubmit without losing anything
```

### Seller account states

| State | She can… |
|---|---|
| `REGISTERED` | fill profile, watch training videos, set up her shop — **cannot publish products** |
| `PAYMENT_SUBMITTED` | same, plus a clear "पेमेंट तपासले जात आहे" banner with the expected wait |
| `ACTIVE` | everything, up to her slot count |
| `PAYMENT_REJECTED` | see the reason, fix it, resubmit |
| `BLOCKED` | admin-suspended, listings hidden |

### The waiting screen **[P0]** — required

The moment she submits the reference number, she lands on a dedicated screen. Not a toast,
not a banner she can miss — a full screen that answers the only question she has: *did my ₹50
go through?*

It shows:

- A large clock or hourglass illustration — no error colours, nothing red
- **तुमचे पेमेंट मिळाले आहे** — "We have received your payment"
- **प्रशासकाच्या मंजुरीची वाट पहा** — "Please wait for admin approval"
- The expected wait in plain words: साधारण २४ तासांत मंजूर होईल
- What she submitted, echoed back: ₹50, the reference number, the date and time
- **मंजूर झाल्यावर तुम्हाला SMS येईल** — "You will get an SMS when it is approved." This is the line that stops her calling support.
- Two buttons: **प्रशिक्षण पहा** (Watch training) and **मदत** (Help, opens WhatsApp)
- A speaker button that reads all of the above aloud in Marathi

After that, the same status persists as a banner across the app, and the state resolves three ways:

| Outcome | What she sees |
|---|---|
| Approved | Push + SMS, and the app opens on अभिनंदन! आता तुम्ही ५ उत्पादने टाकू शकता with a direct button to add her first product |
| Rejected | The reason in plain Marathi, and a **resubmit** button that keeps everything she already entered |
| Still waiting after 48 h | The screen surfaces a "contact support" button, and the record is flagged in the admin dashboard |

> **Design note.** Don't lock her out of the app while waiting for approval. Approval is manual and could take hours; a woman who paid ₹50 and then hits a dead end will assume she was cheated. Let her into the dashboard in a "payment pending" state where she can set up her shop and watch training videos, with the publish button visibly locked. She stays engaged and admin gets a more complete profile to verify against.

### Slot accounting

- `slots_total` = approved packs × 5 · `slots_used` = products not archived
- **[P0]** A slot meter sits at the top of My Business and of My Products: `३ / ५ उत्पादने` with a filled bar. She must always know where she stands without doing arithmetic.
- **[P0]** At 5 of 5, the Upload button shows a lock icon and opens the buy-more screen. Never a silent failure or a raw error.
- **[P0]** Archiving a product frees its slot immediately, with a confirmation that says so plainly.
- **[P1]** Warn at 4 of 5: "one slot left".
- **[P1]** Admin can grant free slots manually (goodwill, a trainee batch, a demo account).
- **[P2]** Bulk packs — ₹150 for 20 slots — once you know whether anyone buys a second pack.

### Payment fraud guards **[P1]**

- **Duplicate UTR detection** — flag if a reference number was already submitted by anyone. This is the obvious attack.
- Store the payer's UPI handle and name from the screenshot for the admin to eyeball.
- Rate-limit resubmissions; log every approve and reject with the admin's identity.

> **Scale warning.** Manual verification works fine up to a few hundred sellers, then it becomes a daily chore. When it hurts, the upgrade path is UPI auto-reconciliation against a bank statement feed, or a real gateway — not more admin staff. Build the queue so a future automated verifier can write to the same table.

---

## 4. Money flow — who pays whom

Two separate flows. Keeping them separate keeps the platform out of the payments business.

| Flow | From | To | Verified by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Registration / slot packs | Seller | **Admin's** account | Admin, manually, against the bank statement |
| Order payment | Customer | **The seller's own** UPI | The seller, in her app |

### Seller's UPI, captured at registration **[P0]**

**Make her upload, not type.** Typing `sunita@ybl` correctly is a real barrier, and one wrong character sends every customer's money to a stranger. Instead:

1. **"Upload your QR"** — she picks the PhonePe/GPay QR screenshot from her gallery, or photographs it. One tap, something she already knows how to do.
2. The app **decodes the UPI ID out of the QR image** client-side (jsQR or ZXing reads the `upi://pay?pa=…` string embedded in it). No typing at all.
3. It shows the decoded ID back in large text: *"तुमचा UPI: `sunita@ybl` — बरोबर आहे का?"* with Yes / No buttons.
4. **Manual typing is the fallback**, not the default — offered only if the decode fails.

Security is unchanged by this, and in one respect improved:

- **[P0]** The decoded ID is what gets stored and paid into, so a typo is impossible by construction. That removes the highest-consequence data-entry error in the whole app.
- **[P1]** A ₹1 verification transfer confirms the handle is real and belongs to her, before her first order.
- **[P1]** Admin sees the decoded ID **and** the uploaded QR image side by side in the verification queue and confirms they match.
- **[P1]** Changing her UPI later re-enters the verification queue and notifies her old number — otherwise it's an account-takeover route.

**Generate the QR rather than only showing her uploaded image.** From her UPI ID you can build a per-order QR with the exact amount already filled in:

```
upi://pay?pa=sunita@ybl&pn=Sunita%20Tai&am=340.00&cu=INR&tn=Order%20SMB1043&tr=SMB1043
```

An uploaded screenshot has no amount in it, so the customer has to type ₹340 by hand and can get it wrong. A generated QR cannot be mistyped. Show her uploaded image only if her UPI ID is missing or unverified.

### Customer payment at checkout **[P0]**

Because the cart splits by seller, **each sub-order gets its own payment step** with that seller's QR:

1. Customer picks **UPI** or **Cash on delivery**.
2. If UPI: a screen showing the seller's photo and shop name, the amount, her QR, and a **"पैसे द्या" (Pay now)** button that fires the UPI intent so GPay or PhonePe opens with everything pre-filled. The QR is for scanning from another device; the button is the fast path on the same phone.
3. Customer enters the UTR / reference number → `payment_status = UPI_SUBMITTED`.
4. The seller sees "Payment received?" on the order with a **Yes, received** button → `UPI_CONFIRMED_BY_SELLER`. Only then does she pack.
5. If she doesn't confirm within N hours, the order surfaces in the admin's stuck list.

> **Consequence to accept.** Since the platform never holds the money, the platform also cannot refund it. A refund is the seller sending money back, which admin can only chase, not enforce. Say this plainly in the return policy, and give the dispute desk the power to block a seller who won't refund. This is the price of not needing a payment aggregator licence, and for v1 it is the right trade.

---

## 5. Share QR & app install link

After her profile is approved, generate a QR she can print, stick on her door, and put on WhatsApp status.

### What the QR encodes

A short link on **your own domain**, never a vendor's: `https://shantaimahilabazar.com/s/sunita-pickles`

### What that link does

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| App installed (Android) | **Android App Links** open her storefront directly in the app |
| App not installed | The web page shows her shop, then sends them to the Play Store |
| After they install | The app opens **on her storefront**, not the generic home screen |

That last row is *deferred deep linking*, and it's the hard part.

> **Do not use Firebase Dynamic Links.** It was shut down on 25 August 2025 — link creation, analytics and deferred deep linking are all dead. Most tutorials you'll find still recommend it.

**Recommended approach — free and native [P1]:**
Append the shop code to the Play Store URL as a referrer, and read it back on first launch with the **Play Install Referrer API**:

```
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shantai.bazar&referrer=shop%3Dsunita-pickles
```

Google supports this natively on Android, it costs nothing, and no vendor can shut it off. On first launch the app queries the referrer, finds `shop=sunita-pickles`, and routes there. If you later ship iOS, that's when to evaluate Branch or AppsFlyer OneLink — pay for it only when you actually need it.

### The QR as a real object **[P0]**

- Generated as a **shareable poster image**, not a bare QR: her photo, shop name in Marathi, "स्कॅन करा आणि ऑर्डर करा", and the QR.
- One-tap **Share on WhatsApp** and **Download** — she will use both constantly.
- **[P1]** A printable A5 PDF version for her door or a stall.
- **[P1]** Admin can bulk-generate posters for a whole training batch.

### Track it **[P1]**

Log scans, installs and orders per shop code, then show her the number on her dashboard: *"१२ लोक तुमच्या QR मधून आले"*. It turns an abstract feature into something she can feel, and it tells you whether the channel works at all.

## 6. Designing for rural, first-time smartphone users

You called this the most important requirement, so it gets its own section and it constrains
every screen in the spec. The assumption throughout: **she may be reading slowly, this may be her
first app that isn't WhatsApp, and the phone is probably shared.**

### Non-negotiables **[P0]**

- **Marathi is the default**, not an option buried in settings. Language is the first screen, two big buttons: **मराठी** / **English**.
- **Every icon carries a Marathi label.** Icons alone are guesses. A truck icon means nothing; "पाठवले" does.
- **Numerals stay in Latin digits** (₹500, not ५००) — that's what's printed on money and shown in every UPI app.
- **Minimum 16px text, 56px buttons, 44px touch targets.** Assume an inexpensive phone and imperfect eyesight.
- **No hamburger menu, no nested drawers.** Four bottom tabs, one level deep. If it doesn't fit in four tabs, it doesn't belong on the dashboard.
- **One question per screen** in every multi-step flow, with progress dots so she can see the end coming.
- **Camera before keyboard.** Product photos come from the camera. Anywhere text is unavoidable, put a **voice input** button next to the field.
- **Plain words, no jargon.** Not "SKU", "inventory", "listing status", "dashboard". Use "माझा व्यवसाय", "माझी उत्पादने", "किती शिल्लक आहे".
- **Colour plus icon plus word** for every order state — never colour alone. 🟡 नवीन ऑर्डर · 🔵 पाठवले · 🟢 पोहोचले.
- **Errors say what to do next**, in Marathi, never a code. "इंटरनेट नाही — पुन्हा प्रयत्न करा" with a retry button.
- **Confirm destructive things, undo everything else.** A confirmation dialog must spell out the consequence: "हे उत्पादन काढले तर एक जागा मोकळी होईल" — not "Are you sure?"

### High-leverage additions

- **[P1] Audio help on every screen.** A speaker button that reads the screen's instructions aloud in Marathi. This is the single biggest accessibility win for a low-literacy user, and it's cheap — pre-recorded clips, not TTS.
- **[P1] A 30-second how-to video** embedded at the top of each major screen, collapsible once she's watched it.
- **[P1] Guided first product.** After approval, walk her through adding product #1 with coach marks. The first success is what determines whether she comes back.
- **[P1] Offline tolerance.** A clear "इंटरनेट नाही" banner, a retry queue for order status updates, and cached product lists. Network in villages drops constantly and she must never lose typed work.
- **[P1] WhatsApp support** as a first-class channel — she already lives there. A help button that opens WhatsApp with her seller ID pre-filled beats any in-app ticket form.
- **[P2] Shared-phone safety.** A quick PIN lock on the seller section, since the phone may be the household's.

---

## 7. Shared foundations

Built once, consumed by all three roles.

- **[P0] Auth** — phone + OTP, role chosen at registration, JWT with refresh, persisted session, guest browsing with a login prompt at the cart. Rate-limit OTP sends. Email and password only for admin.
- **[P0] i18n** — Marathi and English, every string in a resource file including categories, notifications, SMS text and error messages. Marathi default.
- **[P0] Mobile shell** — bottom tab bar, four tabs per role, safe-area insets, back handling. Admin gets a desktop sidebar instead.
- **[P0] Media** — client-side image compression, one to six photos per product, CDN storage, lazy loading, skeleton placeholders.
- **[P0] Legal pages** — terms, privacy, return and refund policy, seller agreement, FSSAI disclosure, and a clear statement that payment is direct between buyer and seller.
- **[P1] Notifications** — push, SMS and WhatsApp, plus an in-app inbox. Templated per event: payment approved, new order, accepted, out for delivery, delivered, review request, low stock, FSSAI expiring, one slot left. SMS matters most — push gets missed.
- **[P1] Order chat** — scoped to one order, buyer to seller, masked numbers.
- **[P1] Search** — server-side index, autosuggest, typo tolerance, and it must handle Marathi queries.
- **[P1] Low-network handling** — cached catalog, retry queue, small payloads.

- Every row taps straight through to the order

**Orders [P0]**

- Buttons mirroring the state machine: Accept · Reject · Mark Packed · **Mark Out for Delivery** · **Mark Delivered (enter OTP)** · **Payment received** · Mark Cash Collected
- Cancel with reason, chat, share a simple bill

**My products [P0]**

### 8.2 Upload Product

A guided wizard, camera-first, autosaving as a draft at every step. Never one long form —
that's where first-time sellers give up.

**Slot check happens before step 1.** If she's at 5 of 5, she sees the buy-more screen instead
of the wizard, phrased as an opportunity, not an error.

- **[P0] Step 1 · Photos** — camera or gallery, one to six images, first is the cover, crop, auto-compress. **[P2]** short video.
- **[P0] Step 2 · Basics** — name per language, category into subcategory, short description with **voice-to-text [P1]**, tags.
- **[P0] Step 3 · Is this an eatable item?** The branch everything else depends on.

**If YES — food. Four fields, nothing else:**

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| **FSSAI number** | 14 digits, first digit `1` (Central) or `2` (State/Basic). Format-checked on the client, verified on the server. |
| **FSSAI expiry date** | Date picker. The platform is legally obliged to pull listings whose licence lapsed, so this drives a nightly auto-hide job with warnings at 30, 15 and 7 days. |
| **Ingredients** | Free text with **voice input** — she speaks it, she doesn't type it. |
| **Veg / Non-veg** | Two big buttons with the green and brown dots. One tap. |

**If NO — non-food. One field:**

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Material** | Free text with voice input, plus quick-pick chips for the common ones — cotton, silk, wool, clay, wood, brass, silver, paper, jute. |

> **What was cut, and why it's safe.** Earlier drafts also asked for a certificate photo, allergens, net weight, shelf life, storage instructions, prep time, size, colour and care instructions. That's 12 fields where 4 will do, and every extra field is a place a first-time seller abandons the form. Admin can verify an FSSAI number directly on the FSSAI public licence portal without her uploading a photo of the certificate. The dropped fields move to **[P2] optional extras**, shown behind an "अधिक माहिती द्या (optional)" link for sellers who want a richer listing — never blocking the first publish.

- **[P0] Step 4 · Pricing** — MRP, selling price, auto-computed discount, unit (kg, g, piece, dozen, litre, ml, set), **variants** for size or weight or colour each with its own price and stock, minimum and maximum order quantity.
- **[P0] Step 5 · Stock** — quantity, low-stock threshold, or made-to-order for unlimited, plus available days.
- **[P1] Step 6 · Delivery** — package weight, delivery charge inherited from the shop or overridden, serviceable pincodes, dispatch time.
- **[P1] Step 7 · Policies** — returnable or not, replacement window, cancellation window.
- **[P0] Step 8 · Preview and submit** — see it exactly as the customer will, then save as draft or submit for approval. **Show the slot cost: "हे प्रकाशित केल्यावर ४ / ५ जागा वापरल्या जातील."**
- **[P1] Helpers** — copy from an existing product, category templates that pre-fill fields, inline photography tips, a warning if the price looks below cost.

### 8.3 My Profile

- **[P0] Personal** — photo, name, date of birth, verified phone, languages
- **[P0] Business identity** — shop name, business type (individual, SHG member, Udyam registered), Udyam number, GSTIN if any, business address with map pin, pickup address
- **[P0] Payment details** — **her UPI ID and QR image**, verification status. This is what customers pay into, so it deserves its own screen, not a buried field.
- **[P0] My subscription** — slots total and used, payment history with dates and UTRs, **buy 5 more for ₹50**
- **[P0] Addresses** — pickup and personal
- **[P0] Settings** — language, notification preferences, hide my phone number, change phone, logout, deactivate or delete account
- **[P1] KYC** — Aadhaar or PAN masked after saving, bank account with IFSC, status badge: pending / verified / rejected with reason
- **[P1] Group affiliation** — SHG or Shantai group name, village, taluka, district, coordinator contact
- **[P1] Document locker** — FSSAI certificate, Udyam, ID proof, each with an expiry and a reminder
- **[P1] My tickets** — support requests and disputes she raised
- **[P2] Badges** — Verified Seller, Top Rated, 100 Orders. Cheap and genuinely motivating.
- **[P2] Refer another woman** — invite link with a reward

### 8.4 Help & Training

What makes the platform work for a first-time seller. A real feature, not a FAQ dump.

- **[P0] How-to videos** — short, vertical, **in Marathi**: how to pay the ₹50 and send the reference number, how to add a product, how to photograph with a phone, how to pack, how to mark out-for-delivery, how to take the OTP, **how to check money came into your UPI**. Downloadable for offline **[P1]**.
- **[P0] Step-by-step guides** with screenshots, searchable
- **[P0] FAQ** with search — lead with "मी ₹५० भरले पण मंजूर झाले नाही" and "पैसे कधी मिळतील"
- **[P0] Contact support** — in-app chat, request a call-back, **WhatsApp link**, helpline number
- **[P0] Raise a complaint or dispute** — attach an order, add photos, track status
- **[P1] Business courses** — modules → lessons → quiz → certificate. Pricing, packaging, talking to customers, **how to apply for FSSAI**, food hygiene, digital payments and fraud awareness, Udyam and GST basics, selling on WhatsApp.
- **[P1] Progress tracking** — percentage complete, resume where she left off, certificate
- **[P2] Live sessions** — webinar calendar, register, reminder, recording
- **[P2] Community feed** — announcements, other sellers' success stories, tips
- **[P2] Downloadables** — label template, price tag, WhatsApp-status poster

## 10. Admin — web console

The job statement: see the whole flow, and step in when something breaks.

- **[P0] Auth and roles** — email and password with 2FA; Super Admin, Ops, Support, Content, Finance; a full audit log of every admin action
- **[P0] Payment approvals queue** — *the new highest-traffic admin screen.* Seller name, phone, amount, UTR, payment screenshot, payer UPI handle, submitted time, **duplicate-UTR flag**, and Approve / Reject with reason. Approving grants 5 slots and notifies her by SMS and push.
- **[P0] Admin payment accounts** — the bank details and UPI QR shown to sellers on the payment screen, editable here so you never redeploy to change an account number
- **[P0] Plan management** — price and slot count per pack, so ₹50 / 5 can change without a code change
- **[P0] Dashboard** — GMV, orders today and this week, active sellers, new registrations, **pending payment approvals**, **pending product approvals**, **stuck orders and SLA breaches**, cancellations, open disputes, cash pending collection
- **[P0] Seller management** — list and search, slot usage per seller, **manual slot grant**, subscription and payment history, KYC queue, document viewer, **FSSAI verification and expiry monitor**, **UPI verification**, block and unblock, audited view-as-seller
- **[P0] Product moderation** — approval queue, approve or reject with reason, **block food listings without a valid FSSAI**, banned-item flags, bulk actions, takedown, category re-mapping
- **[P0] Order monitoring** — every order filtered by status, seller, date or pincode; full timeline and audit per order; **stuck-order alerts** including UPI payments the seller hasn't confirmed; force-cancel; nudge the seller
- **[P0] Catalog config** — categories and subcategories, attributes, units, banners, homepage sections, featured placement
- **[P0] Content** — upload training videos and courses, FAQs, announcements, policy pages, **and the Marathi/English strings**
- **[P1] Share-QR analytics** — scans, installs and orders per shop code; bulk poster generation for a training batch
- **[P1] Customer management** — list, order history, block fraudulent accounts
- **[P1] Dispute desk** — ticket queue with an SLA, assignment, internal notes, resolution; power to block a seller who won't refund
- **[P1] Finance** — subscription revenue report, reconciliation against the bank statement, CSV export
- **[P1] Marketing** — coupons, campaigns, push composer with audience segments
- **[P1] Reports** — sales by category, seller and region; seller leaderboard; funnel; retention; average delivery time; cancellation reasons; slot utilisation
- **[P1] System** — staff and roles, app config, feature flags, maintenance mode, notification templates

`slots_used` is derived — `count(products where status != 'archived')` — not stored, so it can
never drift out of sync with reality.

## 12. Non-functional requirements

- **Mobile-first, then wrappable** — build the UI at phone width; the admin console is the only desktop layout. Keep it all inside a PWA-capable single-page app so it can be wrapped with Capacitor into an APK without a rewrite. The wrapper is also what makes App Links and the Install Referrer API available.
- **Rural usability** — see §6. It is a requirement, not a preference.
- **Performance** — first paint under about three seconds on 4G, compressed images, paginated lists, virtualised long lists. Budget for a ₹8,000 Android phone, not a flagship.
- **Security** — OTP rate limiting, role checks on every endpoint, KYC documents and payment screenshots in a **private** bucket behind signed URLs, PII encrypted at rest, phone numbers masked between parties, a full admin audit trail on every approve and reject.
- **Compliance** — FSSAI number on every food listing, expired licences auto-hidden, seller agreement accepted at registration, return and refund policy published, and an explicit disclosure that order payments go directly to the seller.
- **Accessibility** — 44px minimum touch targets, readable contrast, scalable text, and audio help.

## 13. Growth charts — hers and the platform's

Two audiences that need opposite treatments. Hers exists to **motivate**; admin's exists to
**operate and to report impact**.

> **Start capturing the events in Phase 0, even though the charts ship in Phase 6.** Analytics
> cannot be backfilled. If event logging is added six months after launch, the first six months
> of the platform's growth story simply doesn't exist — which for a programme that will have to
> prove impact to a funder or a government department is an expensive thing to lose.

### 13.1 Her growth **[P1]**

Eight rules, and they matter more than the chart types:

1. **Never compare her to other sellers.** Only to her own past. A leaderboard demotivates the majority who aren't near the top, and it leaks other women's earnings.
2. **The number comes first, the chart second.** Big number, arrow, word — the chart supports it.
3. **Bars, not lines.** Bars are far more legible to someone who has never read a chart.
4. **No axis, no gridlines, no legend.** Label every bar with its rupee value directly. She should never have to read a scale to know what a bar means.
5. **At most 7 bars** — 7 days or 6 months. Never more.
6. **Colour plus arrow plus word**, never colour alone: ↑ हिरवा + वाढ.
7. **Audio.** A speaker button reads the summary aloud in Marathi — same rule as everywhere else in the app.
8. **The empty state matters more than the chart.** With two orders, a chart is noise.

| Card | Form | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| कमाई — earnings | Big number + 7 labelled bars | This month's total, versus last month, with the difference in rupees |
| ऑर्डर — orders | Big number + 7 bars | Order count this week versus last week |
| सर्वात जास्त विकलेले — top products | Horizontal bars with product photos, top 5 | Which product actually earns her the most. The most **actionable** thing she will ever see. |
| किती लोकांनी पाहिले — views to orders | Two numbers, not a chart | "१०० जणांनी पाहिले · १२ जणांनी ऑर्डर केली" |
| परत आलेले ग्राहक — repeat customers | Single number | Buyers who came back this month |
| तुमच्या QR मधून — from her QR | Three numbers | scans → installs → orders |

Beyond the charts:

- **[P1] Milestone cards** — *तुमची १०० वी ऑर्डर!* A celebration beats a chart for motivation.
- **[P1] Shareable monthly summary image** — *या महिन्यात मी ₹4,200 कमावले*, one tap to WhatsApp. Motivation and free marketing in the same feature. Probably the highest-return item in this section.
- **[P2] Plain-language suggestions** drawn from her own data: *शनिवारी सर्वात जास्त ऑर्डर येतात* · *लोणच्याला जास्त मागणी आहे*.

**Empty and low-data states:**

| Her data | What she sees |
|---|---|
| 0 orders | No chart at all. *पहिली ऑर्डर आल्यावर तुमचा आलेख इथे दिसेल* plus a link to the "getting your first order" training. |
| 1–4 orders | The numbers only, no chart. A 3-bar chart looks broken and reads as failure. |
| 5+ orders | Full treatment. |

### 13.2 Admin dashboards **[P1]**

Desktop, data-literate audience, so full dashboard treatment. Four boards.

**A · Usage and adoption**
- **Registration funnel** — registered → paid ₹50 → approved → first product published → first order received. **The single most important chart in the admin panel:** it shows exactly which step women fall out of, and every one of those steps is fixable.
- New registrations over time · active sellers (listed or fulfilled in the last 30 days) versus total registered
- DAU / WAU / MAU, split seller versus customer
- App installs attributed to share QRs · session and screen usage

**B · Selling**
- GMV over time, daily / weekly / monthly
- Order volume and average order value
- **Order status funnel with drop-off %** — placed → accepted → delivered → completed
- Sales by category · sales by district and taluka *(map [P2])* — geographic spread matters for a rural programme
- COD versus UPI split
- Cancellation and rejection rate over time, broken down by reason
- Delivery-time distribution — hours from ACCEPTED to DELIVERED

**C · Money raised by the women** — the impact board
- **Cumulative total earned by all women.** The headline number for the whole platform.
- **Earnings distribution histogram** — how many women earned ₹0, under ₹1,000, ₹1,000–5,000, over ₹5,000. This is the honest chart: it distinguishes helping many women a little from helping a few women a lot, which a total alone hides completely.
- **First-earning conversion** — the share of registered women who have earned at least ₹1. The most truthful single measure of whether the app works.
- **Median** monthly earnings per active seller — median, not mean, because a few high earners will distort the mean badly at this scale
- Earnings by district · month-on-month growth
- Top earners — internal only, never surfaced in the app

**D · Platform revenue and operations**
- ₹50 subscriptions collected over time
- **Slot-pack repurchase rate** — how many women bought a second pack. The clearest signal of whether the business model works at all.
- Pending versus approved payments, and **approval queue age** — how long women are waiting. That's an SLA on somebody's livelihood, so alert on it.
- Product approval queue age · stuck orders · open disputes and resolution time

**[P1] Impact report export.** A programme like this will have to show a funder, an NGO board or a government department: *N women, ₹X earned, Y districts.* Give admin a one-click monthly PDF and CSV. Built once, it saves assembling the same numbers by hand every month forever.

### 13.3 Chart standards

- **Never a dual-axis chart.** Two measures at different scales become two charts, not two y-axes.
- Sequential scales are one hue, light to dark. Diverging scales are two hues with a neutral grey midpoint. Never a rainbow.
- Categorical hues are assigned in a fixed order and never cycled; colour follows the entity, so filtering a series out must not repaint the survivors.
- Two or more series always carry a legend, and up to four are also directly labelled — identity is never colour alone.
- Every chart gets a date-range picker, compare-to-previous-period, and CSV export.
- **Validated categorical palette** (passes lightness band, chroma floor, CVD separation, normal-vision floor and contrast in both themes — use this order):

| Slot | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `#3D5AC4` | `#6E86E0` |
| 2 | `#B31A5B` | `#D4568C` |
| 3 | `#C07C10` | `#B8862F` |
| 4 | `#00897A` | `#1F9C88` |

### 13.4 Data these charts require

Most of it already exists in the schema. What has to be added now:

| Source | Feeds |
|---|---|
| `order_status_events` *(exists)* | order funnel, delivery times, stuck orders |
| `orders` where `COMPLETED` *(exists)* | all earnings and GMV figures |
| `subscription_payments` *(exists)* | platform revenue, repurchase rate, approval queue age |
| `share_link_events` *(exists)* | QR scans, installs, attributed orders |
| **`app_events(user_id, role, event, screen, at)`** ← new | DAU/WAU/MAU, screen usage, funnel steps |
| **`product_views(product_id, viewer_hash, at)`** ← new | views-to-orders, her "how many people looked" card |

---

## 14. Build order

| Phase | Contents |
|---|---|
| **0 — Skeleton** | Routing and role-based shells, every screen with real layout and mock data, the order state machine, **the subscription/slot state machine**, Marathi + English i18n scaffolding, and the design system built to §6's rules |
| **1 — Seller core** | Auth, registration with the ₹50 payment step, product upload wizard with the FSSAI branch and slot gate, my products, order actions, delivery OTP |
| **2 — Customer core** | Explore, categories, product detail, seller storefront, cart split by seller, per-seller UPI checkout, order tracking |
| **3 — Admin** | Payment approvals, seller and product moderation, order monitoring, catalog config |
| **4 — Real backend** | Replace mocks; notifications, reviews, disputes, share-QR generation and tracking |
| **5 — App wrapper** | Capacitor build, Android App Links, Play Install Referrer deep linking, Play Store listing |
| **6 — Growth charts** | Her earnings and orders cards, top products, milestones, shareable monthly summary; the four admin boards and the impact export |
| **7 — Polish** | Training content and audio help, offers, earnings reports |

**One thing from Phase 6 has to happen in Phase 0:** writing `app_events` and `product_views`.
The charts can wait; the data they read cannot be created retroactively.
